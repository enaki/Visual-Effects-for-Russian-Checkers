# SPG-ProjectThe present project aimed to implement the game "Russian checkers", which is a customized version of the classic checkers game. The project was started from an existing project, written in C language. The project was reformatted, and some code sequences were replaced with functions / data structures from the STL library. Emphasis was also placed on replacing old OpenGL code using the Fixed Function Pipeline with OpenGL code using shaders. New features have also been added, such as lighting, texturing and normal mapping to the existing game.Starting source code:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWKTJxrk6uY![alt text](https://github.com/enaki/SPG-Project/blob/master/Documentation/Samples/0.png)## Objectives achieved in the project:- reformatting the code (splitting the code into files with different functionalities, replacing the data structure used with the list in the STL library, replacing the search / filtering functions with functions in the STL library) - adding shaders - replacing the old OpenGL code used to draw checkersboard and parts - improving the quality of checkers - adding lighting - adding texture to the checkersboard - adding normal mapping to the checkersboard - adding to the UI the functionalities of changing the position of light, the specular power of light, enable / disable texture / light / normal mapping - adding help in the UI - modifying the existing functionalities of the game (180 degree rotation of the board, rotating on / off for the game, saving the game) and adapting them to the new added functionalities## Samples### Home![alt text](https://github.com/enaki/SPG-Project/blob/master/Documentation/Samples/1.PNG)### Help Menu![alt text](https://github.com/enaki/SPG-Project/blob/master/Documentation/Samples/2.PNG)### Normal Mode![alt text](https://github.com/enaki/SPG-Project/blob/master/Documentation/Samples/3.PNG)### Lighting On![alt text](https://github.com/enaki/SPG-Project/blob/master/Documentation/Samples/4.PNG)### Lighting and Texture On![alt text](https://github.com/enaki/SPG-Project/blob/master/Documentation/Samples/5.PNG)### Lighting, Texture and Normal Mapping On![alt text](https://github.com/enaki/SPG-Project/blob/master/Documentation/Samples/6.PNG)### Lighting, Texture and Normal Mapping On 2![alt text](https://github.com/enaki/SPG-Project/blob/master/Documentation/Samples/7.PNG)
